# SimplicityHL Escrow/Oracle Prototype

This is an example project powered by the
experimental WASM-based SimplicityHL support
in [Fadroma](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma),
the cross-chain framework by [Hack.bg](https://hack.bg).

## Architecture

We plan to implement the equivalent of "oracle-gated liquidity pools"
in the form of escrow program instances that require a signed witness
of the external price feed at the moment of fulfillment, in order to
release the funds.
