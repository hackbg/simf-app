# SimplicityHL Escrow/Oracle Prototype

This is an example SimplicityHL project powered by Fadroma.

We plan to implement the equivalent of "oracle-gated liquidity pools"
in the form of escrow program instances that require a signed witness
of the external price feed at the moment of fulfillment, in order to
release the funds.

Setup and usage instructions will follow here as we build out the service.
